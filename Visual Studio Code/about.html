        <h2 class="home">Project Overview</h2>
        <pre>In this project, I created a functioning website using HTML and CSS. 
    I also scripted a working math calculator that you can view on the <a href='calculator.html'>Calculator</a> page. 
    I chose this for my project because programming is free and is something engineers are regularly involved in. 
    In addition, coding involves many of the same problem-solving skills that an engineer would use. 
    At first, I wanted to create something that could help with math functions, but that turned out to be too advanced. 
    Ultimately, I decided to make a math calculator using the programming language JavaScript, 
    which has been much more doable and allowed me to learn the basics of scripting. 
    In the next few sections, I will go into depth on each programming language that was used for this project.
        </pre>

        <div id="div1">
        <h3 class="home">HTML</h3>
    <pre>The first language I learned was HTML. 
    According to the w3schools website, "HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages." 
    HTML, standing for Hyper Text Markup Language, describes the structure of a webpage. 
    It forms the backbone of this webpage and is the reason you see anything here at all. 
    The way HTML tells the webpage to display information is through <i>elements</i>. 
    Below is an example of an HTML element.
        </pre>
        
        <div id="imgcontainer">
        <img class="home image lightbox-trigger" src="imgelement.jpeg" alt="Image Of HTML Element" data-large="imgelement.jpeg" width="500" height="100">
        <div class="lightbox" id="lightbox">
            <span class="close-button" onclick="closeLightbox()">&times;</span>
            <img id="lightbox-image" alt="Large Image">
        </div>
        </div>

        <pre>First you have the <b>start tag</b>, 
    followed by the <b>content</b> of the element, 
    and finally the <b>end tag</b> as you can see above. 
    This is essentially how every element works.

    After you know how HTML syntax (rules) and basic elements work, 
    the hard part is knowing what every type of tag does.

    There are over 100 element tags in HTML!

    Below is an image of what the HTML forming this page looks like.
        </pre>

        <div id="imgcontainer">
        <img class="home image lightbox-trigger" src="Screenshot 2023-11-26 182147.png" 
        alt="Image Of HTML Element" data-large="Screenshot 2023-11-26 182147.png" width="900" height="500">
        <div class="lightbox" id="lightbox">
            <span class="close-button" onclick="closeLightbox()">&times;</span>
            <img id="lightbox-image" alt="Large Image">
        </div>
        </div>
        <p class="home">Click Image To Zoom</p>
        <br>
        
        </div><div id="div2">

        <h4 class="home">CSS</h4>
        <pre>The second language I had to learn to make this website was CSS.
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
    The Boston University article <i>What Is CSS?</i> describes it like this: 
    "CSS specifies your document's style, page layouts, colors, and fonts."
    It interacts with the HTML you already have through selectors.
    The categories of CSS selectors include:</pre>
        <li class="list">Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class).</li>
        <li class="list">Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them).</li>
        <li class="list">Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state).</li>
        <li class="list">Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element).</li>
        <li class="list">Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value).</li>

        <pre>Once I knew how to select an element, I began to use declarations to style the webpage.
    Below is an image of what the CSS styling this page looks like.
        </pre>

        <div id="imgcontainer">
            <img class="home image lightbox-trigger" src="Screenshot 2023-11-26 180343.png" 
            alt="Image Of HTML Element" data-large="Screenshot 2023-11-26 180343.png" width="900" height="500">
            <div class="lightbox" id="lightbox">
                <span class="close-button" onclick="closeLightbox()">&times;</span>
                <img id="lightbox-image" alt="Large Image">
            </div>
            </div>
            <p class="home">Click Image To Zoom</p>
        <br>
        </div><div id="div3">

        <h5 class="home">JavaScript</h5>
        <pre>The final programming language I had to learn to make this website is called JavaScript.
    This is the language that makes the math calculator work.
    According to the Amazon Web Services article <i>What Is JavaScript?</i> 
    "JavaScript is a programming language that developers use to make interactive webpages."
    One way it can do this is by taking inputs from the user to deliver an output that 
    is shown on the website. The way that JavaScript tells the computer what to do is through 
    the use of <b>statements</b>. There are five kinds of statements in JavaScript: 
    Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
    Most often, JavaScript uses <b>keywords</b> at the beginning to identify what action to perform. 
    There are a total of 63 JavaScript keywords!
    Below is an example of a statement.</pre>

        <div id="imgcontainer">
        <img class="home image lightbox-trigger" src="examplestatement.jpeg" alt="Image Of JavaScript Statement" data-large="examplestatement.jpeg" width="900" height="60">
        <div class="lightbox" id="lightbox">
            <span class="close-button" onclick="closeLightbox()">&times;</span>
            <img id="lightbox-image" alt="Large Image">
        </div>
        </div>

        <pre>For this project, it required 113 lines of JavaScript code to make this calculator work.
    Although, more complex scripts can take over 300.
    Below is the JavaScript code for the maths calculator.
        </pre>

        <div id="imgcontainer">
        <img class="home image lightbox-trigger" src="JS Screenshot.png" alt="Image Of JS Code" data-large="JS Screenshot.png" width="400" height="600">
        <img class="home image lightbox-trigger" src="JS Screenshot 2.png" alt="Image Of JS Code" data-large="JS Screenshot 2.png" width="400" height="500">
        <div class="lightbox" id="lightbox">
            <span class="close-button" onclick="closeLightbox()">&times;</span>
            <img id="lightbox-image" alt="Large Image">
        </div>
        </div>
        <p class="home">Click Image To Zoom</p>
        </div>
    
        <script src="JavaScript1.js"></script>

        <br>
    </div>
